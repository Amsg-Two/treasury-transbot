# Time to destroy the British "people"!
This bot is only designed to work with the HM Treasury Discord server (https://discord.gg/Rn23HRf4Z7), and it won't work anywhere else until I feel like making the guild ID configurable.
## Instructions:
1. Acquire your token. If you don't know how to do this, I'm sure you can find the instructions online pretty fast.
2. Paste your token into `config.js` in the `token` field **as a string**.
3. Install Node.js (if you don't already have it).
4. Open a command line and enter this directory.
5. Run `node index.js`.
6. **Unless you fork the process, do not close this instance of the command line or else it will not work. If you need to run other commands, open a new window.**
7. Enjoy!
